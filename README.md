##### Copy paste the .apk files in your phone and run, Enjoy.

What does the Repo Contains?

 * Object Detection and using text to speech(Helping people who cannot see)
 * Emotion Detection(Whether a person is happy or sad or suprised, ...)
 

I have used the Microsoft Azure's cognitive-services.<br /> To know more, visit here [Microsoft Emotion Detection API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/cognitive-services/emotion/) 

I have even used Thunkable to use these API's to make an Android app.
visit here, [Easy way of making Android App](https://thunkable.com/)

## NOTE: This requires the internet connection as we send the image data (XML) to the Microsoft server and gets back the response(JSON)

Choose A photo or click one. Hold on....(You should wait for a while)
Because the contents are converted to XML and sent to the Microsoft server. We are waiting for the Response in JSON.
